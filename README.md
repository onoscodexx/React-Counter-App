REACT COUNTER APP
GOAL: Build a simple number counter that can go up, down, or reset.
WHY BUILD THIS?: To learn how to use React’s useState to store changing values (like the count) and how clicking buttons can update things on screen.
FEATURES:
•	Display the current number
•	“+” button to go up
•	“−” button to go down
•	“Reset” button to go back to 0
•	Stop count from going below 0
Time Estimate | 1–2 hours |

How Will We Build It?
1.	Start a React project using Vite (fast and modern tool)
2.	Create a Counter component (like a reusable Lego block)
3.	Use a special React function called useState to remember the number
4.	Add buttons that change that number
5.	Make the number show up on the screen
6.	Add some logic so the number doesn’t go below 0

Key lessons: The react counter app is a simple project that places key focus on understanding React’s useState and how it affects development. 
In simple terms, useState enables functional react components to be interactive and capable of responding to user actions.
It is the reason why the count and setcount in the project code are remembered by our application.

Do well to practice by creating something similar or simply redoing the counter app.
